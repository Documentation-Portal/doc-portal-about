## 2) Guiding you to write Technical Documentation

A Documentation holds your product-related data and information so that anyone after can integrate your software easily. Hence, every piece of software needs proper user-facing documentation.

It doesn’t matter how good your software is, because if the documentation is not readable, people face difficulty using your technical product.

Our [Publisher Guide](https://stg.docs.developer.gov.sg/docs/public/238425294/doc-portal-publisher-guide/#/) will help you to write user-friendly technical documentations.
